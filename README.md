# TGA Image View

A program for viewing 32 and 24 bit TGA images on MacOS. Uses 42's MiniLibx for rendering and my Libft for other tasks.

## Installation

To use the program, simply download the binary file and run it with the path to the TGA image you want to view.

## Usage

To view a TGA image, run the binary followed by the path to the image file:
```bash
./tga_image_view /path/to/image.tga
```
